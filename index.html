  <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  Hi! I'm Eray, a <strong>PhD Researcher in Astrophysics and Data Scientist</strong> based in Germany. I specialize in building end-to-end Python/AI software pipelines that extract weak signals from complex, noisy, TB-scale datasets.
</p>

<p>
  Currently, I am completing my PhD at the >German Centre for Cosmological Lensing (GCCL) in Bochum. My research involves designing scalable pipelines for high-volume imaging data, where I apply Bayesian statistical inference, Monte Carlo methods, and deep learning (PyTorch) to model physical processes and observational systematics. I thrive on moving from abstract problem formulation to modular, production-ready code.
</p>

<p>
  My academic journey includes a BSc in Physics from Heidelberg University and an MSc in Astrophysics (Honours) from the University of Bonn. I enjoy the challenge of interdisciplinary collaboration, and communicating complex concepts to diverse audiences.
</p>

<p>
  I am driven by a "hacker’s mindset"—a passion for rapid prototyping, creative problem-solving, and building reliable software that delivers measurable impact. I am currently looking for opportunities in <strong>Data Engineering, AI, and Analytics</strong> within Switzerland and Germany.
</p>

<p>
  Outside of the terminal, I’m deeply involved in the scientific community through the young German Physical Society (jDPG) and as a social media manager for the Collaborative Research Centre 1491. To recharge, I head underwater as a certified scuba diver or express my creativity through watercolour painting.
</p>
  <p>
    Feel free to get in touch!

      <h3>Simulation of Circumgalactic Dust Extinction in MICE2</h3>
      <p>
      I developed a custom Python pipeline to simulate the impact of circumgalactic dust extinction on source galaxy magnitudes using the MICE2 cosmological simulation. The method uses a KDTree structure to efficiently identify nearest neighbours: for each "source" galaxy, the pipeline computes and sums the dust extinction contributions from nearby "lens" galaxies' halos. The extinction profile is based on observational results from Ménard et al. (2010), as recommended by García-Fernández et al. (2018), and scaled using dust-to-stellar mass ratios from Triani et al. (2020). This modular pipeline can be applied to any cosmological galaxy catalogue to modify magnitudes at arbitrary wavelengths due to circumgalactic dust. The code is available in my <a href="https://github.com/eraygencc/cgm-dust-extinction" target="_blank">cgm-dust-extinction</a> repository.

These visualizations illustrate the spatial distribution and redshift evolution of the simulated \(V\)-band extinction, providing a qualitative check of the implemented dust model and its correlation with the underlying large-scale structure.

    <h3>Detection Bias in Cosmic Shear</h3>
    <p>
      I constrained a pipeline to study detection bias in galaxy surveys by simulating how the presence of nearby bright objects affects the detectability of faint sources. Using <strong>GalSim</strong>, we generate realistic galaxies and inject them into real observational data from the Kilo-Degree Survey. We then use <strong>Source Extractor</strong> to assess which galaxies are detected and under what conditions they are missed. By analyzing these detection outcomes, we derived a fitting function for the detection probability as a function of angular separation and flux ratio with neighbouring galaxies. This function captures how high-density regions, often associated with larger lensing signals, are more prone to detection losses. 
    </p>
    <p>
       The pipeline includes tools to assign weights to galaxies based on this detection probability, which can then be incorporated into measurements to correct for the resulting bias. While originally developed in the context of cosmic shear surveys, this approach is broadly applicable to any study relying on accurate galaxy number counts or shape measurements in crowded fields. The full code is publicly available in my <a href="https://github.com/eraygencc/detection-bias" target="_blank">detection-bias</a> repository.

    <h3> Near-IR Imaging of Radio Galaxy Hosts</h3>
    <p>
  I conducted the reduction and analysis of near-infrared imaging data of six radio galaxy hosts observed with the LUCI1 and LUCI2 instruments on the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). These instruments use HAWAII-2RG (H2RG) detectors, which required a dedicated non-linearity correction to accurately translate incoming photons into electronic signal. 
</p>
<p>
  The custom reduction pipeline involved several key steps using <strong>IRAF</strong>. First, bad pixels were removed using instrument-specific masks. Then, flatfield corrections were applied to address pixel-to-pixel sensitivity variations, ensuring uniform illumination. The most critical step was sky subtraction, which required different strategies depending on redshift. For low-redshift galaxies, master sky frames were created from provided sky exposures. For high-redshift targets without dedicated sky frames, a rolling-median approach was implemented to construct sky estimates directly from science frames. This adaptive technique accounted for spatial and temporal sky variability, which is especially prominent in near-IR observations. Bright stars were also masked to prevent contamination.
</p>
<p>
  Following reduction, I performed photometric measurements on all galaxies using <strong>IRAF</strong>, and for the low-redshift sample, I conducted two-dimensional morphological modeling using <strong>GALFIT</strong>. This project provided valuable hands-on experience in the full near-IR data reduction chain, from raw frames to scientific measurements.

    <h2>Beyond Research</h2>
    <p>
     Outside of astrophysics, I’m passionate about exploring both the deep sea and artistic expression. I’m a certified scuba diver, and I’ve had the chance to dive in breathtaking underwater landscapes from the Red Sea in Egypt to the Pacific coasts of Japan. I also enjoy painting with watercolours — a relaxing way for me to capture moods and moments beyond the realm of data and research. These hobbies keep me grounded and creatively inspired in my scientific journey.
